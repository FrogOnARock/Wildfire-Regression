# Wildfire-Regression
The intention of this model is to predict the number of hectares burned in a wildfire. 

It is my first real project and it utilizes data from the Canadian National Fire Database and an ecological map to predict hectares burned in a wildfire.

Not my best work, but I will come back to it.
